			<h3>The archive and motile space</h3>
			<p>Achieving a multi-chain archive is possible in the present, but does have its technical limitations 
				when it comes to cohesion. Where tech falls short, art has not by connecting us all, despite its provenance. 
				Giving more space to create, collect, document, and showcase.</p>

				<p>The SPC Archive consists of independent studio releases, collaborative solo and group showcases, and events. 
					Broadening the visibility of a global shift toward creative independence is an intentional now.</p>

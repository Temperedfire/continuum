Without regurgitating the same old line that’s been uttered a million of times, art made from forgotten or scrapped materials holds a bit of a soft spot. It’s not just a matter of recycling or reusing, but a profound act of conveying things into new and meaningful context.

## Have A Seat

There it was, a new photograph found in my wallet of a worn chair along the side of an aged building, littered with daily use. A finding full of character and no one in sight.

<br>The human species is an interesting addition to the complex puzzle that is our world. We have the ability to adapt to our environment, whether it's the vastness of nature or the confines of urban spaces. In turn, we adopt our surroundings, imbuing them with familiarity, comfort, and a sense of safety. From the most basic act of tagging a restroom wall, to creating temporary escape spots during the daily grind of a 9-5 work routine, our interactions with shared spaces become personalized reflections. 

Michael Wolf's work serves as a notable reminder of these characteristics and intricacies. Who would’ve thought an empty chair would say so much? The gift of [Features](https://feat-ur.es/gift-shop/chairs/) is a gracious token of discovery along Hendr's travels.

## The Torn Identity

<br>We’ve printed far too much for it to die. There’s an irreplaceable feeling that comes with holding a worn book, flipping through the pages of a new zine, or displaying a print of your favorite album cover on a wall. At this time, the presence of print persists through a tug of deconstructive and reconstructive qualities more than ever before. As numerous libraries close down suddenly, others are scrambling to [convert their books into electronic formats](https://blog.archive.org/2023/04/20/san-francisco-board-of-supervisors-unanimously-passes-resolution-in-support-of-digital-rights-for-libraries/) in order to stay afloat. On the other hand, creative book design, independent publishing, and book and print fairs are thriving. 

Maybe it’s all a medley of an identity crisis because our relationship with print is changing. The external representations we create become a part of what we carry, even after the process of creating them has come to an end.

## ᐅ Clear Browsing Data

In many ways, the internet can be seen as an extension of our own virtual landfills of data. The access to an abundance of information that we have today can either be seen as a source of arbitrary distractions or as seeds of resourcefulness, depending on how we choose to make use of it.

<br>There are relics left in some of the most random corners of the internet, yet to be seen once or ever again. They get buried beneath layers of newer information, and Internetjunk nails this very concept. The pieces resemble traces of cache and cookies accumulated over time, sticking to our virtual footprints as we browse and interact with the latest thing online.

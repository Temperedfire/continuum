## Human Errors


![Error #3](https://assets.objkt.media/file/assets-003/QmYhy9FAHRQTvige9838m7uPQiS6mN1FhVhfbnkdTaSZm7/artifact) <br><center><em>#Error 3</em>, Edgar Invoker 2021. <a href="https://objkt.com/asset/hicetnunc/94495">(Source)</a></center>

<br>Edgar Invoker’s use of acrylic and analog techniques to emulate digital defects is quite the mind warp. His work holds a mirror between the two approaches, while cleverly repurposing the technical incidents of glitch and noise with humanistic expression. Post-digital art reflects on our symbiotic and disruptive relationship with tech in everyday life.

<br>Most physical work is treated with delicacy in mind. There are countless stories, told and untold of art museums damaging paintings, breaking sculptures, or attracting acts of vandalism. It’s different when artists choose to damage their work intentionally. Being digital adds an element to this by going against the safety of undo buttons, cleanliness, or perfectionism often associated with using it as a medium. We have yet to go a day without looking at Bouilabasse’s work.

<br>One of the numerous companies with their hands in too many pots that plague humanity. Fuck Nestle and the corpos. Make their bottomless means of consumption your own.

<br>Can't go wrong with jazz! Cheers to a rockin' session of free jazz just short of 20 minutes. Much love to both groups and Brazil!

## Cloaked Unions in Open-sourced Societies

Union is everywhere, even in spaces where anonymous identities are the norm. Tribes form, codes stick and break. Somehow, the underlying factor of what made a lot of this possible leads back to code, but we can dive into the Internet of Things and etc some other time. For now, let’s continue to embrace the visual metaphors of anonymous unions in an eco driven by trustless tech.

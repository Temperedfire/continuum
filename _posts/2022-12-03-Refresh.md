An Awaited F5

<br><br><br>
## Origin.

Humans have sought out many approaches to obtaining resources on Earth for decades. After the twenty-first century, the realizations were finite and it became clear that these methods were no longer sustainable. With the acceptance of a few, a path to space opened and the first expedition began.

## AstroMunk

The AstroMunk were testing subjects before the next phase of human expansion into outerspace. Their unit was tasked to study an array of Earth Tongue fungi, and often ate them leading to leaps of development. The AstroMunk referred to their humanoid counterparts as Neolecta, a name then adopted by the unit during the establishment of the Commune. 

-Co-settlers of the Commune and assisted the creation of flux technology.

## Neolecta

The first expedition for gold and other suitable resources was thwarted by approaching a globular cluster.Â During the radiative effects of the incident, the Neolecta witnessed the Grand Rift, a nebulous valley with multiple parallel existences. Seconds later, they were pulled into one of them.

-Radiated humans with skeleton exteriors. Deemed the First Seers of the Grand Rift.

## SEGUE-I

An odd occurence happened when passing through the Grand Rift. The Neolecta were followed by an influx of eyes that mimicked the units' movements upon returning back to base. The Segue were welcomed as a new unit of Commune after some time. It wasn't as if the earlier occupants had any other choice really, the Segue would not leave.

-Yes, the HUGE eyes would NOT leave.

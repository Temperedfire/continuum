						<h4>Law of C°ntinuity</h4>
						<p>CONTINUUM ✱SPC proposes the importance of creating space for artists, makers, and creatives
							alike. Among new routes to be explored, 20% of mint will be allocated into the
							work of independent artists and initiatives. The plan is to continue to support an
							ever-growing space of creatives because it’s the best way forward.<br></p>

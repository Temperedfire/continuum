			<h3>The archive and motile space</h3>
			<p>Achieving a multi-chain archive is possible in the present, but does have its technical limitations
				when it comes to cohesion. Where tech falls short, art has not by connecting us all, despite its provenance.
				We propose the importance of creating space for artists, makers, and creatives alike. As part of this endeavor,
				20% of revenue from the program will go to empowering independent artists and initiatives. Giving
				more space to create, collect, document, and showcase.</p>

				<p>The ✱SPC Archive consists of independent studio releases, collaborative showcases, and events. 
					Broadening visibility of a global shift toward creative independence is an intentional now.</p>

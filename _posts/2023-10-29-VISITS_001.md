## Brazilian artist Aldivo Rodrigues, part of the collective UDntKnwWhoWeAre, delves into the seamless fusion of visual and auditory art forms. In this conversation, he shares insights of his upcoming exhibition that sheds light on how artist-led curation can challenge traditional hierarchies and provide a platform for marginalized perspectives, ultimately shaping a more inclusive and dynamic art landscape.


<br>
**✱SPC**: How did you become interested in Web3 and blockchain technology, and how has it influenced your work as an artist?

**Aldivo**: The first time I heard about blockchain technology was around two years ago, when I had a conversation with Oli Gustavo. He was playing a few games, like Axie Infinity, and told me how it had changed his life. Another friend of mine played PVU and other games. I tried playing a few of them, but games aren't really my thing.

At that time, I had no idea about art in NFTs, and after finding out, I started to keep an eye on it. We met more artists in NFTs when [Zala](https://twitter.com/zala_faz_zalas) onboarded us into the process. She loved our masks, helped us make our collective wallet, gave us some Tezos to start with, and introduced us to more groups of artists in the scene. 

Web3 has had a huge influence on our journey, and made it possible for us to realize our dreams of having better equipment. It also encouraged us to present our art in the best possible way and always evolve. Still amazed by those who have followed our journey so far.

<br><br>**✱SPC**: How do you see the relationship between traditional art and digital art in the context of Web3?

**Aldivo**: I believe that there is room for both traditional and digital art. I must admit, we have started to focus a little more on digital art due to the public's interest, but our work has always been a mix of the two. From physical masks to photographs, paintings, music, and so on, we constantly try to express ourselves as broadly as we can.

**✱SPC**: What inspired your journey into curation, and how was the experience of working on a project of this scale? 

**Aldivo**: It’s kind of funny because I didn’t think of myself as a curator until I was called one. I started to realize that I've been doing this work for a long time for our collective as well, and I took the thought of curating more seriously once I had a sense of responsibility with the Identidades exhibition.

I think what brought me to this role was always being behind opportunities for artists and making sure that we could be seen. That’s something that really centers my life. It took me a while to realize that I was doing curatorial work because curating is taken in a very institutional and academic way. Very different energy from the artists and scenes I’ve always been involved in. It was difficult to see myself in this role, being self-taught and having a journey in street art that was open and accessible to everyone.

**✱SPC**: You have an incredible selection of artists for the Identidades exhibition! How did you go about inviting them for it?

**Aldivo**: This is a very personal curation and was carried out in about one year within the Web3 space. Since I enjoy many art forms, I searched for individuals who were diverse in terms of color, gender, and geography and who created a variety of works of art that shared similar dialogue with one another.

I take into account consistency, technical ability, and how much artists are able to express who they are through art. Artists who are always sharing information and access within collective ideals are things that I consider a lot. When it comes to onboarding artists, some of whom I've known for more than 10 years, these individuals are incredibly talented. I've always wanted to see them dedicating themselves totally to their craft and having their space to shine.

**✱SPC**: Having to travel for individual onboarding sessions can have unexpected challenges, how did you prioritize and adapt your curation process?

**Aldivo**: Certainly, the process of traveling to people to do the onboarding was a lot of effort and dedication, but it also gave me the chance to be more careful with the help of choosing works by new artists. The individual workshops allowed me to give as many details as possible about how to get started, and it's a type of work that will continue with the onboarded artists, leaving them open to ask any questions after the exhibition as well.

The online onboarding sessions have also been very satisfying, from the many calls every day going over the project to choosing and minting the pieces. Another session will be held after the exhibition teaching the final steps. I really appreciate [Qab’s](https://twitter.com/qabqabqab) help with the onboarding process, and loved this collective experience where people gave their all to make it all possible.

**✱SPC**: What role do you believe technology and digital platforms play in the experience of an exhibition?

**Aldivo**: I think the role of digital platforms in exhibitions is to bring accessibility to more people and break the geographical and physical barriers. I am very happy with our partnership with [Collector](https://collector.sh), they are doing an excellent job launching a new platform in Solana and focusing on curatorships. This is bringing new air to the scene and many possibilities for artists.

In the end, I believe that visibility changes everything and can make a big difference for artists, especially Latin and Brazilian artists. I loved this experience so much, and I really plan to continue this work in the future.
